Our food and drink is conveyed to our guests by the chefs, in our open plan restaurant and kitchen. The stories sewn into the dining experience are passed from those who work tirelessly, from soil to shore, to provide us with the harvest of natural ingredients that we share. Produce from our own farm lays the roots of the harvest on our tables and the understanding of what it means to work with the land. We can cater to almost any dietary requirements, just let us know when you book and we will happily accommodate. We can be found on the first floor of an old coffee warehouse in Stockport Old Town. Our dining room accommodates a maximum of 40 guests, achieving an intimate and personal experience. We function in an open space that combines both kitchen and dining room. The team moves between tables with stories of our farm and the people we work with - each story part of a greater narrative of the meal that makes up an evenings experience.",
